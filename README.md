# Journal.TXT - Single-Text File Journals - The Human Multi-Document Format for Writers

Write your journal in a single-text. Example:

```
--- text
year:  2017
month: July
day:   Wed 19
---
Let's reinvent push-button publishing on the internets! 
Use a single-file for your journal / diary / blog. That's it.
---
day:   Thu 20
---
Crazy idea? Let's put up a website and a example blog auto-generated from journal.txt.
---
day:   Fri 21
---
Did you know? The single-file format works great for advent calendars 
or beer-of-the-day calendars.
---
day:    Sat 22
---
Let's add another example. A diary about the Oktoberfest 2016. Prost. Cheers.
---
day:    Sun 23
---
Let's rest.
```

How does it work?

The single-text file is a series of meta data blocks and text blocks. 

Note: You do NOT need a title for you entries. 

Use the meta data block for adding the date.
